# Healthy Home Prediction with Map Visualization

The objective of this project is two sided. One is for the practice of geo related packages like `geopandas`, to visualize the geo information in map pattern. Another is to do the **__regression__** for the NO, NO$_2$, PM2.5 level given the house location and distence to the nearby highway, commercial complex, etc. <br><br>

I used the tree based regressor for the above objective, because it has the virtue of being more robust than the linear regression models, and more explination power than the deep learning models.
