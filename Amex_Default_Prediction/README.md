# Amex Default Prediction

The objective of this project is to predict the probaility that a customer does not pay back their credit card balance amount in the future, based on their monthly customer profile. The target binary variable is calculated by observing __*18 months performance window*__ after the latest credit card statement, and if the customer does not __*pay due amount in 120 days after*__ their latest statement date, it is considered a default event. <br><br>

I'm excited about this project as it not only deals with an _industrial scale of data (50 GB)_, but also that the records are organized across _different time periods_. This allows me to explore both traditional machine learning algorithms designed for tabular data, as well as emerging algorithms that can handle longitudinal data effectively.
