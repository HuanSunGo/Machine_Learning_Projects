# Flood Image Classification with CNN  
A good prediction of flood events enables the societyâ€™s better response to the flood and will eventually benefit the people, the property and minimize the loss. Here in this capstone project cohosted by KPMG and Columbia University, we adopted a cutting-edge Deep Learning Image Classification model to further drive the business application.
